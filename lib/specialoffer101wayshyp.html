					<b>With great power comes great responsibility. Do you think

					<p align="left">Dear Friend,<br>
					<br>
					We&#8217;ve all heard the saying, &#8220;It&#8217;s not what you know, it&#8217;s who 
					you know.&#8221;&nbsp; But guess what?&nbsp; You could know the 
					most important people in the world, but if you can&#8217;t put them 
					under your spell and get them to do what you want, the point 
					of knowing them is <b>USELESS.</b><br>
					<br>
					If you&#8217;ve ever wanted to learn how the most persuasive and 
					influential people in the world can &#8220;magically&#8221; control 
					others with nothing more than their words, listen up and 
					listen good.<br>
					<br>
					What you are about to discover is the only method known to 
					man that enables one human to legally maneuver the mind of 
					another in a way that is so camouflaged, that those being 
					treated as puppets are often thankful for the experience 
					afterwards!<br>
					<br>
					My name is Paul Mascetta and I learned a long time ago that 
					in the age of information, no information is more valuable 
					than that which enables you to get what you want.&nbsp; 
					Everything else is just plain useless.<br>
					<br>
					For years, I got by in the sales industry with my God-given 
					ability to strike up conversations with people.&nbsp; But in 
					the end, that just wasn&#8217;t good enough.<br>
					<br>
					Sales is a tough industry, unless, you are part of the 
					super-elite salespeople who basically write their own 
					paychecks.&nbsp; The only checks I was writing were to pay 
					bills, and most of the time they bounced.<br>
					<br>
					I was an average sales-person at best.&nbsp; And the only 
					time my paychecks were somewhat decent was when I worked 75 
					to 80 hours a week (which is like having two jobs).<br>
					<br>
					Long story short, my girlfriend and I were living up in a 2 
					room basement apartment with mice everywhere and a baby on 
					the way.<br>
					<br>
					The bathroom was so small that I had to step outside of it 
					to dry myself after a shower.<br>
					<br>
					My bank account was negative $102 from all the overdrafts 
					and I was eating tuna out of the can on a daily basis.<br>
					<br>
					At one point, we actually used cash advances from credit 
					cards to pay the rent.<br>
					<br>
					As you can imagine, at that rate not only was I broke, but I was also knee deep in debt.<br>
					<br>
					I decided I needed to make a change very quickly or else I 
					would just keep sinking.<br>
					<br>
					I started searching for as many self-improvement resources 
					as I could get my hands on as well as sales books so that I 
					could further develop my craft.&nbsp; Day in and day out, I 
					sacrificed as much sleep as I could and used that time to 
					download information to my mind.<br>
					<br>
					I learned a ton of information.<br>
					<br>
					The problem is as enlightened and as motivated as I was 
					after reading each book or listening to each tape, I found 
					myself powerless in terms of what action to take.<br>
					<br>
					In fact, the only course of action that I did take usually 
					consisted of buying another enlightening product.&nbsp; It was an endless cycle of hope and spending.<br>
					<br>
					That&#8217;s when I realized that execution was equal to or even more important than simply learning the information.&nbsp; And my ability to execute it rested exclusively on 
					how well I could build relationships with others.<br>
					<br>
					Why? <br>
					<br>
					I was in sales and the only thing that separated me from the 
					guys making the serious money every month, was my ability (or 
					lack thereof) to build relationships with clients.<br>
					<br>
					Effectively building and maintaining clients in sales 
					enables you to:<br>

					<p align="left">On the dating

					<br>

					<font color="#CC0000" size="5" face="Tahoma">Here&#8217;s Why 
					Hypnotherapy Delivers Results Where Other Attempts Fail 
					Miserably&#8230;</font></b></p>
					<p align="left"><font face="Georgia" size="4">The success of 
					every single attempt to better your life using methods other 
					than hypnotherapy rides on one single factor, which seems 
					pretty simple yet it&#8217;s the reason why a majority of people 
					never actually make it in life.<br>
					<br>
					And that factor is called <b>taking action</b>. <br>
					<br>
					People love to plan, love to dream and love to imagine the 
					future.<br>
					<br>
					How many times have you thought about what you would feel 
					like if you lost that extra weight or met that special 
					person or made that million dollars?<br>
					<br>
					How many times have you postponed actually doing something 
					about it?<br>
					<br>
					How many times have you planned to wait until January 1st to 
					start exercising? <br>
					<br>
					Or waited until you felt better about yourself to get into 
					the dating scene more aggressively?<br>
					<br>
					Or told yourself, you need to get all your bills paid before 
					you can venture into other areas to make more money?<br>
					<br>
					Does this day, when all action is supposed to take place, 
					ever actually come? And if it does, does it last?<br>
					<br>
					In most cases, it doesn&#8217;t. Most of us are creatures of 
					habit.&nbsp; The human mind loves comfort and familiarity. Taking action to change your life can be both 
					uncomfortable, unfamiliar and downright terrifying at times.<br>
					<br>
					So left to your own devices, chances are you&#8217;ll never take 
					the right course of action or continue it as long as you 
					should.
					<br>
					<br>
					And taking no action is a failure in itself&#8230;point blank.<br>
					<br>
					It&#8217;s not your fault that things happen this way.<br>
					<br>
					What I&#8217;m about to tell you is a vicious truth that many so 
					called &#8220;self-improvement experts&#8221; want to keep buried away 
					forever like a dreadful secret:<br>
					<br>
					&#8220;Almost all self-improvement products on the market today 
					are designed with the sole purpose of up-selling you into an 
					endless cycle of buying.&#8221;<br>
					<br>
					Now I&#8217;m not saying that there aren&#8217;t products out there 
					jam-packed with powerful information that you can use to 
					fuel your progressive enhancement.<br>
					<br>
					But what I am saying is that in most cases, only half of  the story is being told. <br>
					<br>
					To get access to the other half, you have to purchase 
					something else; and then something after that; and then 
					something after that.<br>
					<br>
					And the reason why is simple.<br>
					<br>
					People would rather subscribe to a dream than to the 
					convoluted world that is sometimes reality.<br>
					<br>
					It&#8217;s always easier to take the path of least resistance. <br>
					<br>
					And that path usually consists of procrastination defined by 
					constant planning - or dreaming as I see it - through 
					purchasing the &#8220;next big answer to all of your problems&#8221;.<br>
					<br>
					Realizing this evil truth exists and unfortunately I was 
					falling victim to it. I decided I needed to look for 
					something else, something that wouldn&#8217;t be designed to keep 
					me running around in circles while the &#8220;self improvement 
					experts&#8221; got rich.<br>
					<br>
					That&#8217;s when I decided to try hypnotherapy. Because with 
					hypnotherapy, there&#8217;s no time to think about not taking 
					action or procrastinating. Your mind is pre-programmed for 
					success before you start talking yourself into failure.<br>
					<br>
					While I wasn&#8217;t exactly talking myself into failure, I was 
					suffering from something known as analysis paralysis. <br>
					<br>
					Basically, I was spending an inordinate amount of time 
					thinking about what I should do&#8230;and in the process I wasn&#8217;t 
					actually doing anything.<br>
					<br>
					I had tried it all&#8230;with the exception of hypnosis.<br>
					<br>
					For months on end, I scrimped and saved until I finally had 
					enough money to book a private session with Steve.&nbsp; 
					Luckily for me, he wasn&#8217;t charging as much as he is today 
					for his life-changing forms of therapy.<br>
					<br>
					After I explained to Steve what problems I was having in my 
					life, he decided that best course of action would be to use 
					his hypnosis recordings as fuel for constant action.<br>
					<br>
					These would prevent me from running in circles as I did in 
					the past and help me keep moving in a positive direction.<br>
					<br>
					Once things were going as planned, it was time to take my 
					life to the next level.<br>
					<br>
					That&#8217;s when I was introduced to perhaps the most powerful 
					form of hypnosis on the planet&#8230;Conversational Hypnosis.<br>
					<br>
					I say that because this form of hypnosis equips you with the 
					highest power of all&#8230;the transcendent ability to hypnotize 
					others!<br>
					<br>
					You see, instead of spoon-feeding me his craft in small 
					doses and having me run back to him like a starving hostage, 
					Steve was actually transferring the power into my hands and 
					putting me in the position of paramount control.<br>
					<br>
					He was teaching me how to use the brains, abilities, 
					talents, power, money, strengths, looks, desires, passions 
					and all other positive attributes of others to my advantage 
					all without deceptively manipulating them.<br>
					<br>
					After just one session, my life started to change. I was 
					closing sales easier than I did before.<br>
					<br>
					After 2 sessions, I was not only closing better, I was 
					closing more people.<br>
					<br>
					By the time we reached 5 sessions, I had to pay an assistant 
					out of pocket just to take care of my paperwork because I 
					was too busy closing deals.<br>
					<br>
					It came a point where all I did for 8 hours a day was take 
					checks, credit cards and cash payments from people.<br>
					<br>
					Within 1 year, I was able to purchase a house, a brand new 
					SUV and even a $5,000 Breitling watch.<br>
					<br>
					But there&#8217;s more to it than that&#8230;<br>
					<br>
					You see, the empowerment that I gained from conversational 
					hypnosis allowed me to:</font></p>

					But that&#8217;s not all&#8230;<br>
					<br>
					My life took a drastic turn for the better in all areas.<br>
					<br>
					On the dating scene, I was a force to be reckoned with. I 
					never found myself lonely and miserable. <br>
					<br>
					In fact, the hardest part of my day became trying to fit a

					Then the day came where I met the woman of dreams. We&#8217;re

					Steve was so elated with the impact that Conversational 
					Hypnosis had on my life that he decided I should be the 
					Editor of his world famous website and have the sole 
					responsibility of researching and testing various self 
					improvement products and resources to see just how effective 
					they are. <br>
					<br>
					I&#8217;m at a point in my life where I can do what I am 
					passionate about and make a nice living doing so.<br>
					<br>
					That nice living enables me to have a beautiful home, money 
					in the bank, a nice portfolio of investments and best of 
					all; I can enjoy a nice rib eye at a 5 star restaurant 
					instead of tuna fish.<br>
					<br>
					The impact that conversational hypnosis has had on my life 
					has been so dynamic that I made a promise to never stop 
					learning and mastering it.<br>
					<br>
					As I always say, once you decide there&#8217;s no room for 
					improvement, you begin making room for failure.<br>
					<br>
					When I started learning these techniques, I had a hunch that 
					something positive would happen, but I had no idea how 
					drastically my life would change.<br>
					<br>
					I also had no idea that I was learning from an expert who 
					learned these techniques from the one and only Richard 
					Bandler&#8230;creator of Neuro Linguistic Programming!</font></p>

					<br>
					And it&#8217;s no surprise why.<br>
					<br>
					What Steve was doing with these celebrities was nothing

					<br>
					He was taking ultra-successful superstars who had traveled

					<p align="left"><font face="Georgia" size="4">This very

					(NLP) is built on the platform of the teachings of pioneers 
					like Dr. Milton Erickson and Ivan Pavlov who together 
					changed the world forever.&nbsp; That is something you 
					simply cannot put a price tag on.<br>
					<br>
					What Exactly is Neuro-Linguistic Programming?<br>
					<br>
					Founded by Richard Bandler and John Grinder, 
					Neuro-Linguistic Programming or NLP is a widely accepted 
					skill-set system built on the relationship between one&#8217;s 
					neurology, language and programming and the powerful impact 
					that relationship have on one&#8217;s life.<br>
					<br>
					These three components are what typically make up every 
					experience we have as humans. <br>
					<br>
					Our Neurological System is responsible for every single 
					function of the body.<br>
					<br>
					Our Language is the avenue which we use to communicate.<br>
					<br>
					And our Programming sets forth a vision of the world as we 
					see it.<br>
					<br>
					The techniques encapsulated in NLP are based on the behavioral pattern discoveries of Dr. Milton Erikson, who founded the American Society of Clinical Hypnosis. He is arguably the most clinically successful psychiatrist who ever lived.<br>

					He realized through experiments with dogs, that you could 
					get an animal to do something through a stimulus that had 
					nothing to with the response.<br>
					<br>
					Let me explain.<br>
					<br>
					Pavlov would feed dogs food covered with chili powder.&nbsp; 
					As he was feeding them, he would ring a bell.<br>
					<br>
					Eventually, all he would have to do is ring the bell and the 
					dogs would associate the sound of the bell with food and 
					begin to salivate.<br>
					<br>
					The bottom line&#8230;he could make a dog salivate by simply 
					ringing a bell.</font></p>
					<p align="center"><font face="Tahoma"><b>
					<font color="#CC0000" size="5">But Could These Same 
					Principles be Applied to Humans?</font></b></font></p>
					<p align="left"><font face="Georgia" size="4">That&#8217;s the 
					question that Milton Erickson wanted to answer.<br>
					<br>
					You see, where most scientists saw people as machines, 
					Erickson knew that dealing with the human mind - with its 
					emotion, thought capacity and belief system- would be more 
					challenging than just training dogs.<br>
					<br>
					There in lies the difference.&nbsp; Dogs don&#8217;t have a belief 
					system.&nbsp; Therefore, to truly get the same result with a 
					human, you would have to get into his or her belief 
					system&#8230;and Erickson did that better than just about anyone.<br>
					<br>
					Using hypnosis, he could entrance anyone into doing anything 
					at anytime. <br>
					<br>
					Richard Bandler would later redevelop these techniques to 
					create NLP where one human could tap into the mental program 
					of another through words.<br>
					<br>
					After being personally trained by Bandler, Steve G. Jones, 
					M.Ed. combined all his previous knowledge about hypnosis and 
					NLP and transformed it into what he called <b>&#8220;Ultimate 
					Conversational Hypnosis.&#8221;</b><br>
					<br>
					With Conversational Hypnosis, anyone could be easily trained 
					to do what Erickson and Pavlov did over 100 years ago but in 
					today&#8217;s world.<br>
					<br>
					You see, in those days there was no such thing as text 
					messaging, e-mail or even telephones.<br>
					<br>
					Back then, these techniques were only effective if you could 
					get someone to sit in front of you and wait to be entranced.<br>
					<br>
					But now the world is a completely different place and all 
					the techniques of the past needed to be modified.<br>
					<br>
					That&#8217;s what separated Steve&#8217;s course, Ultimate 
					Conversational Hypnosis from everything else.<br>
					<br>
					It enabled a person to implement these techniques through 
					modern-day forms of communication.<br>
					<br>
					That&#8217;s when all the chaos began&#8230;<br>
					<br>
					Suddenly more and more people began hearing about the 
					effects of Conversational Hypnosis and how it could allow a 
					person to dominate the thoughts and actions of someone else 
					that it quickly grew into a frenzy.<br>
					<br>
					The demand for information on this wondrous form of hypnosis 
					was beyond anything he could fathom.<br>
					<br>
					Hundreds of e-mails were pouring in each day requesting 
					private sessions, digital downloads, teleseminars and 
					countless other resources that people could use to learn 
					Conversational Hypnosis.<br>
					<br>
					It got to a point where Steve was only getting about 3 hours 
					of sleep on a good night. <br>
					<br>
					That&#8217;s when it hit me&#8230;<br>
					<br>
					Why not build something that could serve as a universally 
					accepted resource on Conversational Hypnosis? Something that 
					could allow the power of this astounding form of hypnosis to 
					be placed in the hands of anyone&#8230;just as it was for me.<br>
					<br>
					And why not make it so affordable that just about anyone 
					could own it?<br>

					<p align="left"><font face="Georgia" size="4">In the 
					informative second module of Ultimate Conversational 
					Hypnosis, Steve goes over the structure of the course and 
					gives a synopsis of how conversational hypnosis came to be.<br>
					<br>
					Steve G. Jones talks about the &#8220;superstars&#8221; of 
					conversational hypnosis and how they contributed to its 
					evolution to what is now being taught in Ultimate 
					Conversational Hypnosis. Starting with Ivan Pavlov and his 
					research with animals, all the way to Richard Bandler, 
					co-founder of NLP. Steve goes in-depth to discuss how the 
					techniques came to be and how they will affect YOUR life.<br>
					<br>
					Module two goes over the powerful techniques you will learn 
					as the course moves forward. You will learn specific NLP 
					techniques such as pacing, mirroring, and leading and you 
					will learn how to apply them to your life to gain rapport 
					with others. You will learn how to ready a persons 
					representational system so that you can better communicate 
					with them.<br>
					<br>
					You will learn the powerful techniques of parts therapy 
					manipulation and hand shake instant induction. Imagine 
					inducing someone into a trance with only a hand shake. These 
					are very powerful techniques that you will learn and use to 
					your advantage!<br>
					<br>
					You will learn the art of pattern interrupt and direct 
					command. Although direct command isn&#8217;t embedded or secretive 
					like other conversational hypnosis techniques, it is 
					powerful! You will learn how to use direct command in your 
					life to get what you want.&nbsp;<br>
					<br>
					In this module, Steve also talks about embedded commands. 
					You will learn how to use embedded commands in text 
					messages, emails, on the phone and in person! Embedded 
					commands are a powerful way to make Ultimate Conversational 
					Hypnosis work for you!</font></p>

					<p align="left"><font face="Georgia" size="4">Now that 
					you&#8217;ve seen what&#8217;s included in this astounding course, the 
					unconditional money-back guarantee and how it&#8217;s changed the 
					lives of other people, make the most crucial decision in 
					bringing all &#8220;hear say&#8221; to reality&#8230;<b>TAKE ACTION</b> and 
					allow it to change your life!<br>
					<br>
					Capitalize on the wondrous benefits and positive life 
					changes that this course will provide by ordering it right 
					now at the extremely undervalued price of just <strike>$199</strike>
					<b>$17!</b></font></p>
					<p align="left"><font face="Georgia" size="4">
				    Why do I say this price is undervalued?<br>
				    <br>
				    First, prior to the release of this course, the only way you 
					  could get your hands on this information was through a 
					  private session with Steve, which costs $25,000 for <u>ONE</u> 
				    hour.<br>
				    <br>
				    With <b>Ultimate Conversation Hypnosis</b> you&#8217;re getting 18 
					  hours of material, which is invaluable.<br>
				    <br>
				    Secondly, there is no loss of time or inconvenience or 
					  travel costs as you can access the material right from your 
					  own home.&nbsp; Remember, a private session with Steve 
					  involves a trip to Savannah Georgia -- and a hefty price tag 
					  along with it.<br>
				    <br>
				    Thirdly, the bonuses alone are valued at several hundred 
					  dollars.<br>
				    <br>
				    Lastly, this resource will arm you with abilities that will 
					  enrich your life spiritually, emotionally, physically and 
					  financially by tenfold.&nbsp; How can you put a price tag on 
					  that?<br>
				    <br>
				    The information within this course and the format which 
					  Steve has delivered it cannot be found anywhere else in the 
					  world but right here on this webpage.&nbsp; That means that 
					  it is truly exclusive to those who own and practice it.<br>
				    <br>
				    But aside from being exclusive, it is empowering.&nbsp; It 
					  will enable you to achieve goals and gain an advantage that 
					  remains invisible to the rest of the world.<br>
				    <br>
				    You will be able to take your life and dreams in the 
					  direction that you&#8217;ve always wanted.<br>
				    <br>
				    Steve G. Jones always tells me to live in Abundant 
					  Possibility.
				    <br>
				    <br>
				    But with Conversational Hypnosis, he&#8217;s empowered me to live 
					  in Abundant Reality! <br>
				    <br>
				    Now you can too.<br>
				    <br>
				    To Your Success!<br>

							Ultimate Conversational Hypnosis<br>
							Frequently Asked Questions</font></b></p>
							<p><font size="4" face="Georgia">
							<font color="#CC0000"><b>What exactly is 
							conversational hypnosis?</b></font><br>
							<br>
							Conversational hypnosis is a body of knowledge 
							comprising such fields as NLP, instant hypnosis, 
							Ericksonian hypnosis and the art of persuasion. 
							Drawing on technologies that are over 100 years old, 
							conversational hypnosis allows its practitioners to 
							control, persuade and manipulate others through the 
							use of words. When we combine this with Steve G. 
							Jones' cutting edge new techniques, we get the body 
							of knowledge known as ultimate conversational 
							hypnosis.<br>
							<br>
							<font color="#CC0000">
							<b>What are some of the things I will learn by using 
							Steve's Ultimate Conversational Hypnosis course?</b></font><br>
							<br>
							You will learn things such as:<br>
							<br>
							- The various applications of conversational 
							hypnosis.
							<br>
							(Ex. sales, dating, managing children, negotiating 
							real estate prices, getting out of traffic tickets, 
							negotiating car prices)<br>
							<br>
							- The history of conversational hypnosis.<br>
							<br>
							- How to persuade people using analog marking 
							(embedded commands) through face-to-face 
							conversation, e-mails, text messaging, phone 
							conversations, etc. <br>
							<br>
							- How to establish rapport.<br>
							<br>
							- How to use representational systems (visual, 
							auditory, and kinesthetic) to persuade others.<br>
							<br>
							- Pacing and mirroring techniques (syntax, posture, 
							breathing, voice tone, voice tempo, facial 
							expressions, eye blinks, etc.)<br>

							<font color="#CC0000">
							<b>What qualifications does Steve G. Jones have that 
							allow him to teach the art and science of 
							conversational hypnosis?</b></font><br>
							<br>
							Steve G. Jones holds a bachelors degree from the 
							University of Florida, a masters degree in Education 
							from Armstrong Atlantic State University and is 
							currently working on a doctorate in education at 
							Georgia Southern University. Steve is the author of 
							22 books on hypnosis. He is the founder of the 
							American Alliance of Hypnotists, he's on the board 
							of directors for the Los Angeles chapter of the 
							American Lung Association and is the director of the 
							Steve G. Jones school of hypnotherapy. He is board 
							certified by the American Board of Hypnotherapy, a 
							member of the national guild of hypnotists and he is 
							listed in the International registry of professional 
							hypnotherapists. Steve G. Jones has also been 
							practicing hypnotherapy and training hypnotherapy 
							for over 20 years.<br>
							<br>
							In addition to Steve's educational background and 
							extensive experience, he has also worked with 
							numerous celebrities. Among them are Tom Mankiewicz, 
							the writer of Superman, Geraldine Saunders, the 
							writer of The Love Boat and many others. Steve was 
							also contacted by &quot;The View&quot; television show 
							starring Whoopi Goldberg and Barbara Walters to 
							provide video footage of his hypnotherapy programs.<br>
							<br>
							<font color="#CC0000">
							<b>I've noticed similar types of courses being offered on this topic. Why should I choose Ultimate 
							Conversational Hypnosis by Steve G. Jones?</b></font><br>
							<br>
							You will notice that other programs are taught by 
							people who lack the credentials to be educators. In 
							our survey of other similar programs, we found that 
							none of the trainers had any formal, educational or 
							psychological training. Steve G. Jones offers 
							doctoral level knowledge, and with the psychological 
							and educational background that allows this 
							information to be delivered in a clear, concise and 
							powerful way. In the 1980s, Steve was personally 
							trained by Richard Bandler, the founder of NLP. Mr. 
							Bandler was personally trained by Milton H. 
							Erickson, MD. This combination of Mr. Bandler and 
							Dr. Erickson's techniques served as a foundation for 
							the modern day techniques, which Steve himself has 
							added to the world of conversational hypnosis.<br>
							<br>
							<b><font color="#CC0000">Is everyone hypnotizable with covert hypnosis?</font></b><br>
							<br>
							Different people have different levels of 
							suggestibility. Some people can be hypnotized easily 
							by an untrained person walking up to them and saying 
							&quot;Sleep!&quot; Other people require a more detailed 
							approach to be hypnotized. In the 18 hours of 
							instruction with the accompanying 600+ page 
							transcript of that instruction, you will learn 
							countless techniques to hypnotize people. By the 
							time you're done with the program, you will know 
							which techniques to use and when to use them. This 
							will make you an unstoppable force that no one can 
							resist. Essentially, no matter what level of 
							suggestibility your subject has, you will instantly 
							know which techniques to use on them.<br>
							<br>
							<b><font color="#CC0000">How long does it take to start using conversational 
							hypnosis using Steve's system?</font></b><br>
							<br>
							You can begin applying the techniques the moment you 
							receive the program. These techniques are 
							straightforward and easy to use. In fact, your 
							homework assignments begin right away with Steve 
							encouraging you to apply the techniques in your 
							everyday life. Order the program now, and later 
							today you will be using the techniques on friends, 
							acquaintances and people you don't even know.<br>
							<br>
							<font color="#CC0000"><b>Can I make a person I really like fall in love 
							with me and chase after me?</b></font><br>
							<br>
							Absolutely. The entire program, from beginning to 
							end, is designed to give you the powerful tools that 
							you will need in order to control any situation. 
							These tools can easily be used to win the hearts of 
							others. Although every technique that Steve teaches 
							in the program is completely moral and ethical, the 
							techniques are also extremely powerful. Due to the 
							powerful nature of this program, we request that if 
							you desire to use it for bad purposes that you 
							please refrain from doing so. As mentioned in the 
							program, you will have the equivalent of a black 
							belt in conversational hypnosis. With great power 
							comes great responsibility.<br>
							<br>
							<font color="#CC0000"><b>What if a person is a lot more 
							attractive than me?</b></font><br>
							<br>
							This program gives you the tools to bypass that 
							factor. Essentially, the human brain is like a 
							computer. Your computer doesn't know how attractive 
							you are unless you tell it. You will be programming 
							the computers (minds) of others by telling them 
							exactly what they should think of you. Through a 
							series of easy-to-learn techniques, you will be able 
							to actually program the mind of another with 
							specific thoughts about how attractive, funny, 
							successful, motivated, confident, etc. you are. This 
							will override any previous programming they had 
							about you.<br>
							<br>
							<font color="#CC0000"><b>If I still have questions 
							about the course, who can I ask?</b></font><br>
							<br>
							Yes, we offer 24 hour phone support. If you're 
							calling from the U.S. please dial: (877) 944-9766. 
							International callers please dial: (718) 833-5299. 
							You can also <b>
							<a target="_blank" href="http://www.hypnosistocontrol.com/support.php">
							e-mail Steve's staff</a></b>. You can expect a reply 
							within 24 hours and usually much quicker than that.<br>
							<br>
							<font color="#CC0000"><b>How does Steve's guarantee 
							work? Please explain.</b></font><br>
							<br>
							The guarantee is simple. If, for any reason or no 
							reason at all you're not 100% satisfied with the 
							course material, then Steve doesn't want you to pay 
							for it. Just let us know within eight weeks of your 
							purchase date and you'll receive a full, no hassle, 
							refund.<br>
							<br>
							<font color="#CC0000"><b>What's actually included in 
							Steve's &quot;Ultimate Conversational Hypnosis&quot; course?</b></font><br>
							<br>
							18 hours of recorded audio, a complete transcription 
							of the entire course, four bonus audios and two 
							bonuses e-books.<br>
							<br>
							<font color="#CC0000"><b>Can Steve guarantee my 
							success with this program?</b></font><br>
							<br>
							Steve G. Jones, M.Ed. has been training people in 
							hypnotherapy for over 20 years. With his world 
							renowned and easy-to-follow techniques, <u>ANYONE</u> 
							can master the art and science of ultimate 
							conversational hypnosis.<br>
							<br>
							<b><font color="#CC0000">I know a lot of NLP and 
							hypnosis already. Is this course really going to 
							teach me something that I don't already know?</font></b><br>
							<br>
							Many people have been trained in NLP and hypnosis. 
							Steve G. Jones, M.Ed. was personally trained by 
							Richard Bandler. It is highly unlikely that you 
							currently possess the vast knowledge that Steve G. 
							Jones has on this topic. Steve's knowledge of NLP 
							and hypnosis combined with his 20+ years of 
							experience adds up to a volume of knowledge 
							possessed by less than 1% of the world's population.<br>
							<br>
							<font color="#CC0000"><b>How do I know that in this 
							program Steve isn't using hypnosis to control me?</b></font><br>
							<br>
							You have Steve's word that he will not use any 
							hypnotic techniques in this program to control you. 
							Aside from that, Steve reveals ALL of his secrets in 
							this very comprehensive program.<br>
							<br>
							<font color="#CC0000"><b>I don't feel comfortable 
							using my credit card online. Can I place my order 
							over the phone?</b></font><br>
							<br>
							Although online ordering is extremely safe, you can 
							also place your order via phone. Our office is open 24 hours. If you're calling 
							from the U.S. please dial: (877) 944-9766. 
							International callers please dial: (718) 833-5299. 
							You can also make arrangements  
							to pay by check.<br>
